# wildfly-stig-baseline

InSpec profile to validate the secure configuration of JBOSS Wildfly EAP server, against [DISA](https://iase.disa.mil/stigs/)'s **JBOSS Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG)**.

## Getting Started  
It is intended and recommended that InSpec run this profile from a __"runner"__ host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely over __winrm__.

__For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.__ 

Latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.


### Run with remote profile:
You may choose to run the profile via a remote url, this has the advantage of always being up to date.
The disadvantage is you may wish to modify controls, which is only possible when downloaded.
Also, the remote profile is unintuitive for passing in attributes, which modify the default values of the profile.
``` bash
inspec exec https://gitlab.mitre.org/inspec/wildfly-stig-baseline/master/archive.tar.gz
```

Another option is to download the profile then run it, this allows you to edit specific instructions and view the profile code.
``` bash
# Clone Inspec Profile
$ git clone https://github.com/mitre/wildfly-stig-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz

# Need to run the command 
$ /bin/sh /opt/wildfly/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect 
# Enter P to permanetely accept the certificate

# How to run 
$ inspec exec wildfly-inspec --attrs wildfly-stig-baseline/attributes.yml

#If running the profile before running the wildfly-hardening cookbook set the following in wildfly-stig-baseline/attributes.yml:
connection: '--connect'

# If running the profile after running the wildfy-hardening cookbook set the following in wildfly-stig-baseline/attributes.yml:
connection: '-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/opt/wildfly/standalone/configuration/a.jks --connect -u=test1 -p=test'

```

## Attributes (Configuration)
You may alter the default settings of the profile by creating/modifying a yaml 
encoded 'attributes' file. The following yaml code details the currently 
supported attributes, and can also be viewed as the attributes.yml file in this 
repository.

``` yaml
#command to use when the wildfly cli is configured with a password
#-u=<username to login in a>
#-p=<password>

#If running the profile before running the wildfly-hardening cookbook set the following in wildfly-inspec/attributes.yml:
connection: '--connect'

#If running the profile after running the wildfy-hardening cookbook set this in wildfly-inspec/attributes.yml:
connection: '-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/opt/wildfly/standalone/configuration/a.jks --connect -u=test1 -p=test'
high_availability: 'false'
ldap: 'false'



#node.default['wildfly-hardening']['c'] = '--connect'

```
