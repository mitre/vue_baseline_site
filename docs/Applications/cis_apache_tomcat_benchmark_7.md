# (WIP) InSpec CIS Apache Tomcat v7 Benchmark

You can use this profile to evalute your Tomcat-7 instance to the CIS Benchmark.

The controls **still use** the `xml` resource and function correctly but **help / interest welcome** on completing the `tomcat_*` resources (see the start in the [libraries](./libraries/) directory) in the other branches off `master`.

#### NOTE: Tomcat Resources

Our current implamentation in the controls use the InSpec `xml` resource which is a bit complicated but works fine. 

We are working on moving to a custom set of `tomcat_*` resources for much clearner and more direct InSpec controls. 

***the custom `tomcat_*` resource is in very early alpha not yet complete and is not complete***
