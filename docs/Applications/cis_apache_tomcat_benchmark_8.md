#### NOTE
##### There be dragons

The controls **still use** the `xml` resource and function correctly but **help / interest welcome** on completing the `tomcat_*` resources (see the start in the [libraries](./libraries/) directory) in the *other branches* off `master`.

#### ALPHA: Custom Tomcat Resources

Our current implamentation in the controls use the InSpec `xml` resource which is a bit complicated but works fine. 

We are working on moving to a custom set of `tomcat_*` resources for much clearner and more direct InSpec controls. 

***the custom `tomcat_*` resource is in very early alpha not yet complete and is not complete***
